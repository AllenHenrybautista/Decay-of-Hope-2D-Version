​Here is a collection of assets for you to get creative and make your own isometric maps. Great for playing RPGs over a VTT!

This pack is themed "forest", and you will find assets ranging from grass, plants, bushes, rocks and mushrooms, to over 40 different styles of trees. It is also possible to mix and match different styles of trunks and leaves to create your own customized trees.

In total, there are 232 graphics for you to pick.​ Take into consideration the 12 available color palettes, that number goes up to 2784!

These props are perfect for nature settings like forests, woods, shrublands, grassy plains and rocky terrain, amongst others scenarios.

Two color palettes are available for free: Black&White and Vanilla.

If you pay $6 or more, you receive ten additional color palettes: Sun, Fall, Cold, Mint, Fae, Bleak, Paradise, Shadow, Lush, Poison.
You also get the example maps depicted on the screenshots.

All images files are in PNG format, so you can use your preferred image editor to assemble them using layers. Once your map is finished, save it as an image and import it on your VTT.

Enjoy!
